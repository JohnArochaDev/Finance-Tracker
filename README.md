1. Add a sliding system, so when you log in, if no data is saved on a new account, the computer asks questions, and the user fills it in. after all the data has been filled in, it will save it to the DB and open the home page

2. Make all the state global, make sure not to add individual state for every expense rather the array of labels and array of amounts that are used. Maybe connect them by name to the charts they effect. 

3. Make a way to see how long until someone pays off there debt. 

4. Make a way to login / logout using Oauth, maybe 2F Auth
